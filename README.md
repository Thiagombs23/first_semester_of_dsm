# Best exercises and codes that I have created during my First Semester as a student of Software Development

In this folder will see samples of the kind of codes that I have learned to create using the following languages: 
-JavaScript
-HTML
-CSS

I have also been introduced and learned how to create and analise data banks and repositories using SQL, but due to lack of origianl and authoral material, I will not be posting any of it in my page yet.
